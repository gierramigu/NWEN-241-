NWEN, Assignment 2 300411917

Part 1: Pointer Concepts 

Task 1

1. 

float number = 5.0;
float *numbptr = number;

2.
long int *func1(int, int);

3. 
(const is a type that can't be changed while its being argued into the method)
char *func2(const char* test); 

4.
int *arrIntPoint[20];

5.
char *strings[] = {"cyan", "magenta, "yellow", "black"};


Task 2 

1. 
Numeric value of the expression &u is 1100

2.
Numeric value of the expression &v is 1101 since incrementing by 1 would only move by 1 byte

3.
pv is intially assigned into character A, and uses the memory address of v.

4.
066 

5.
C



Task 3 

1. 
57 80 
80 80

2.
int 1 - It's assignment has been changed from 26 to 57 at the very end of the program hence why its 57.
int 2 - *int2Ptr gets the address of int2 and returns a point towards it. Which then goes to that 
address and changes the value of int2 to 62 and makes int2Ptr assigned to int1Ptr. So now int1ptr has
the address from int2ptr which is int2 with the value of 62. The value is then changed to 80 
from *int1Ptr.
*int1Ptr - 80 is assigned to *int1ptr 
*int2Ptr - Since int2Ptr = int1ptr and then from the next line of code int1Ptr = 80 which is also applies to int2Ptr


Task 4 


1.
1102

2.
1118

3.
1106

Task 5

1.
std::cout << seasons[i] << "\n";

2.
delete[] strPtr;
